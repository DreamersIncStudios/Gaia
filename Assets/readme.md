🌍 The Gaia Collective
A Shared World Framework by Dreamers Inc Studio

The Gaia Collective is the foundational open-world framework powering all future projects by Dreamers Inc Studio. Designed for scalability, flexibility, and immersion, Gaia provides both editor tools and runtime systems to manage the complexities of large, dynamic game worlds.

✨ Features
🔄 Dynamic Day/Night Cycle
A seamless real-time lighting and environmental system that simulates natural day-night progression, supporting time-based events, visual transitions, and gameplay effects.

🌧️ Dynamic Weather System
A modular and reactive weather system capable of triggering various atmospheric conditions—rain, storms, fog, and more—tied to regions, seasons, or player actions.

👥 NPC Spawn & Management
Rule-based spawning and behavior control for NPCs, including population balancing, schedule-driven behavior, and AI ecosystem integration.

⛏️ World Resource Management
Persistent world resource tracking, spawning, and depletion systems that support gameplay loops like harvesting, economy, and player-driven environmental impact.

⚖️ Level & Difficulty Balancing
World-scope scaling tools for adjusting enemy levels, spawn types, and resource richness based on player progression, zone difficulty, or dynamic world state.

🛠️ Editor & Runtime Integration
Gaia is built to support both in-editor workflows and runtime systems, allowing for:

Visual configuration of world rules

Live simulation of cycles and systems

Integration with existing scene and entity systems

🚀 Usage
Note: This framework is currently in active development and intended for internal use across Dreamers Inc Studio projects. External documentation and public access will be provided in future versions.
